# Functional Requirements

## Authentication
- The API must support user registration with email and password.
- Passwords must be hashed before storage.
- The API must support user login and return a JWT token for authenticated requests.
- All task management endpoints must require authentication via JWT.

## Task Management
- Users can create, read, update, and delete their own tasks.
- Each task must have: title, description, priority, due date, status (complete/incomplete), and category.
- Tasks must be associated with the user who created them.
- Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

## Priority & Due Dates
- Tasks must support priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- Tasks must have an optional due date field.

## Filtering & Search
- The API must support filtering tasks by status, priority, due date, and category.
- The API must support searching tasks by title or description keywords.

## Data Validation
- All input data must be validated (e.g., required fields, valid email, password strength, valid dates).
- Invalid requests must return appropriate error messages.

## User Management
- Users can update their profile information (e.g., name, email, password).
- Users can view their own profile.

## Security
- All sensitive endpoints must require authentication.
- Passwords must never be returned in API responses.
- JWT tokens must be validated on each request.

## Error Handling
