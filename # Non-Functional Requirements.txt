# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance
- The system should respond to API requests within 500ms under normal load.
- The system should support at least 100 concurrent users.

## Security
- All passwords must be hashed using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- JWT tokens must be signed with a secure secret.
- Sensitive data must not be exposed in logs or error messages.
- Rate limiting must be applied to authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- CORS must be configured to allow only trusted origins.

## Scalability
- The system must be designed to allow horizontal scaling of the API and database.
- The database schema should support future features (e.g., notifications, task sharing).

## Usability
- The API must follow RESTful conventions and be well-documented.
- Error messages must be clear and actionable.
- The frontend must be responsive and accessible.

## Maintainability
- The codebase must use TypeScript for type safety.
- The project must follow standard coding conventions and be well-documented.
- Automated tests must be provided for core business logic and API endpoints.

## Availability & Reliability
- The system must be deployable using Docker for consistent environments.
- The system must handle and log errors gracefully.
